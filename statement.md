# Problem Statement: Movie Recommendation System

With thousands of movies available on streaming platforms, users face decision paralysis and struggle to discover content matching their preferences. 
Traditional browsing methods are time-consuming and inefficient, leading to poor user experience and content underutilization.

**Problem**: How can we build an intelligent system that accurately recommends movies based on user preferences and content characteristics?

**Solution**: Develop a hybrid recommendation system combining:
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends similar movies using TF-IDF and cosine similarity on genres/descriptions
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on similar users' ratings using K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Popularity-Based**: Displays trending movies for new users

**Expected Outcome**: An interactive web application that provides real-time, personalized movie recommendations, 
improving content discovery and user satisfaction while demonstrating both machine learning approaches effectively.
